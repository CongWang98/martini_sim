starting mdrun 'NPM1'
200000000 steps, 2000000.0 ps (continuing from step 199804460, 1998044.6 ps).

Writing final coordinates.

 Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was permanently on during the run per user request.
 Average load imbalance: 1.2%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 63%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 0.8%.
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 0 % Y 0 % Z 0 %
