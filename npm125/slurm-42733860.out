Energy minimization has stopped, but the forces have not converged to the

stopped because the algorithm tried to make a new step whose size was too
small, or there was no change in the energy since last step. Either way, we
regard the minimization as converged to within the available machine

 Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was permanently on during the run per user request.
 Average load imbalance: 1.1%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 64%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 0.7%.
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 0 % Y 0 % Z 0 %
