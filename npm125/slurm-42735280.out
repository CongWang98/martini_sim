Command line:
  gmx_mpi grompp -f prod_0.mdp -c eq3.gro -p chromatin_dna.top -t eq3.cpt -o prod_0.tpr -maxwarn 1

Replacing old mdp entry 'nstxtcout' by 'nstxout-compressed'
Replacing old mdp entry 'xtc_grps' by 'compressed-x-grps'

NOTE 1 [file prod_0.mdp]:
  The group cutoff scheme is deprecated since GROMACS 5.0 and will be
  removed in a future release when all interaction forms are supported for
  the verlet scheme. The verlet scheme already scales better, and it is
  compatible with GPUs and other accelerators.

Generated 1 of the 253 non-bonded parameter combinations
Excluding 3 bonded neighbours molecule type 'NPM1'

NOTE 2 [file chromatin_dna.top, line 6]:
  System has non-zero total charge: -1456.000000
  Total charge should normally be an integer. See
  http://www.gromacs.org/Documentation/Floating_Point_Arithmetic
  for discussion on how close it should be to an integer.
  


Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group System is 56445.00
Reading Coordinates, Velocities and Box size from old trajectory
Will read whole trajectory
Last frame         -1 time 100000.000   
Using frame at t = 100000 ps
Starting time for run is 0 ps

Step 1036160: Run time exceeded 0.247 hours, will terminate the run

 Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was permanently on during the run per user request.
 Average load imbalance: 1.0%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 63%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 0.6%.
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 0 % Y 0 % Z 0 %
