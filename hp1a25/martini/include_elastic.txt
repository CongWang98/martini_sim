Each HP1 dimer has 2 ordered regions. 1 (chromodomain) CD, and 1 (chromo-shadow domain) CSD. We want to include:
1. Interactions within the same CD.
2. Interactions within the same CSD.
3. Interactions between the two CSDs.
(Anything besides these 3 should be excluded)

Residues (note 1-191 is the first monomer, 192-382 is the 2nd monomer):
CD1: 17-72
CSD1: 115-176

CD2: 208-263
CSD2: 306-367
