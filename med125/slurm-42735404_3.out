starting mdrun 'med1'
200000000 steps, 2000000.0 ps (continuing from step 200000000, 2000000.0 ps).

Writing final coordinates.

Back Off! I just backed up prod_0.gro to ./#prod_0.gro.1#

NOTE: 90 % of the run time was spent communicating energies,
      you might want to use the -gcom option of mdrun
