starting mdrun 'med1'
200000000 steps, 2000000.0 ps (continuing from step 1401740,  14017.4 ps).

Writing final coordinates.

 Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was permanently on during the run per user request.
 Average load imbalance: 1.0%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 58%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 0.6%.
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 0 % Y 0 % Z 0 %
